I conducted a series of API tests on Restful Booker using Postman to explore its hotel booking functionality. I tested creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting bookings. Through these tests, I gained a better understanding of RESTful API concepts, including HTTP methods, status codes, and JSON data formats. I also learned how to handle authentication and error responses in API testing."
